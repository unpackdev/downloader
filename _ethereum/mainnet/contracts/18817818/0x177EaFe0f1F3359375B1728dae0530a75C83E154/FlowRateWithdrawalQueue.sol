 * @title  Flow Rate Withdrawal Queue
 * @author Immutable Pty Ltd (Peter Robinson @drinkcoffee)
 * @notice Queue for withdrawals from the RootERC20BridgeFlowRate.
 * @dev    When withdrawals are delayed, they are put in the queue defined in this contract.
 *         The "queue" is actually a per-user array that gets bigger each time a withdrawal
 *         is added. Users can choose which withdrawals they are interested in and process
 *         just those withdrawals.
 *         Note: This code is part of RootERC20BridgeFlowRate. It has been separated out
 *         to make it easier to understand the functionality.
 *         Note that this contract is upgradeable.
