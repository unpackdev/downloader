 * The encoding for the 5 types of delegate registry hashes should be as follows
 *
 * ALL:         keccak256(abi.encodePacked(rights, from, to))
 * CONTRACT:    keccak256(abi.encodePacked(rights, from, to, contract_))
 * ERC721:      keccak256(abi.encodePacked(rights, from, to, contract_, tokenId))
 * ERC20:       keccak256(abi.encodePacked(rights, from, to, contract_))
 * ERC1155:     keccak256(abi.encodePacked(rights, from, to, contract_, tokenId))
 *
 * To avoid collisions between the hashes with respect to type, the hash is shifted left by one byte and the last byte is then encoded with a unique number for the
 * delegation type.
