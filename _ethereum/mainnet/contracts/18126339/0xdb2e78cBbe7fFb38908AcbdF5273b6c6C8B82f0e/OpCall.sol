/// @title OpCall
/// @notice Opcode for calling eval with a new scope. The construction of this
/// scope is split across integrity and runtime responsibilities. When the
/// integrity checks are done the expression being called has all its integrity
/// logic run, recursively if needed. The integrity checks are run against the
/// integrity state as it is but with the stack bottom set below the inputs to
/// the called source. This ensures that the sub-integrity checks do not
/// underflow what they perceive as a fresh stack, and it ensures that we set the
/// stack length long enough to cover all sub-executions as a single array in
/// memory. At runtime we trust the integrity checks have allocated enough runway
/// in the stack for all our recursive sub-calls so we simply move the stack
/// bottom in the state below the inputs during the call and move it back to
/// where it was after the call. Notably this means that reading from the stack
/// in the called source will 0 index from the first input, NOT the bottom of
/// the calling stack.
