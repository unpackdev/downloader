/// @title LibIntegrityCheck
/// @notice "Dry run" versions of the key logic from `LibStackPointer` that
/// allows us to simulate a virtual stack based on the Solidity type system
/// itself. The core loop of an integrity check is to dispatch an integrity-only
/// version of a runtime opcode that then uses `LibIntegrityCheck` to apply a
/// function that simulates a stack movement. The simulated stack movement will
/// move a pointer to memory in the same way as a real pop/push would at runtime
/// but without any associated logic or even allocating and writing data in
/// memory on the other side of the pointer. Every pop is checked for out of
/// bounds reads, even if it is an intermediate pop within the logic of a single
/// opcode. The _gross_ stack movement is just as important as the net movement.
/// For example, consider a simple ERC20 total supply read. The _net_ movement
/// of a total supply read is 0, it pops the token address then pushes the total
/// supply. However the _gross_ movement is first -1 then +1, so we have to guard
/// against the -1 underflowing while reading the token address _during_ the
/// simulated opcode dispatch. In general this can be subtle, complex and error
/// prone, which is why `LibIntegrityCheck` and `LibStackPointer` take function
/// signatures as arguments, so that the overloading mechanism in Solidity itself
/// enforces correct pop/push calculations for every opcode.
