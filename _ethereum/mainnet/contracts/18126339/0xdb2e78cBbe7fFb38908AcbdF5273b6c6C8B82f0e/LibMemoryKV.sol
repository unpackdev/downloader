/// @title LibMemoryKV
/// @notice Implements an in-memory key/value store in terms of a linked list
/// that can be snapshotted/exported to a `uint256[]` of pairwise keys/values as
/// its items. Ostensibly supports reading/writing to storage within a read only
/// context in an interpreter `eval` by tracking changes requested by an
/// expression in memory as a cache-like structure over the underlying storage.
///
/// A linked list is required because unlike stack movements we do NOT have any
/// way to precalculate how many items will be included in the final set at
/// deploy time. Any two writes may share the same key known only at runtime, so
/// any two writes may result in either 2 or 1 insertions (and 0 or 1 updates).
/// We could attempt to solve this by allowing duplicate keys and simply append
/// values for each write, so two writes will always insert 2 values, but then
/// looping constructs such as `OpDoWhile` and `OpFoldContext` with net 0 stack
/// movements (i.e. predictably deallocateable memory) can still cause
/// unbounded/unknown inserts for our state changes. The linked list allows us
/// to both dedupe same-key writes and also safely handle an unknown
/// (at deploy time) number of upserts. New items are inserted at the head of
/// the list and a pointer to `0` is the sentinel that defines the end of the
/// list. It is an error to dereference the `0` pointer.
///
/// Currently implemented as O(n) where n is likely relatively small, in future
/// could be reimplemented as 8 linked lists over a single `MemoryKV` by packing
/// many `MemoryKVPtr` and using `%` to distribute keys between lists. The
/// extremely high gas cost of writing to storage itself should be a natural
/// disincentive for n getting large enough to cause the linked list traversal
/// to be a significant gas cost itself.
///
/// Currently implemented in terms of raw `uint256` custom types that represent
/// keys, values and pointers. Could be reimplemented in terms of an equivalent
/// struct with key, value and pointer fields.
