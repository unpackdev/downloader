 * This contract has been modified for use in thunderhead-labs/stflip-contracts. 
 * 
 * Modifications in order of appearence:
 * 1. Removed event `DelegateChanged` since a delegate cannot change
 * 2. Removed event `DelegateVotesChanged` since EIP20 `Transfer` makes this redundant
 * 3. Removed `delegate` and `delegateBySig` since delegation is disabled
