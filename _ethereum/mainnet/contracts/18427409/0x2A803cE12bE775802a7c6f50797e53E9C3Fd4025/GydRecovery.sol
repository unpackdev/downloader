    /* We account for burn actions (= when the mechanism is triggered) in two ways:
    - For partial burns, where less than the whole underlying supply is burnt, we store the percentage that has been burned in a cumulative adjustment factor. We can convert from and to "adjusted" amounts by multiplying/dividing by the adjustment factor. The "staked amounts" for liquidity mining are in units of *adjusted amounts*.
    - For full burns, where the whole supply is burnt, the conversion is not 1:1. Instead, we store a counter to distinguish whether a full burn has happened since the last update, and we also store some history.
    Adjusted amounts are only meaningful when the last full-burn-id is stored as well. All this is important to correctly perform accounting for withdrawals and for rewards.
