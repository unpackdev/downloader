三千点保卫战已经打响！
Three thousand points defense battle has begun!

本代币所有手续费收益将用来保卫大A 3000点！！

In the realm of finance where bulls and bears dance,
A line stands firm, as steadfast as ancestral lance.
Three thousand points, a bastion held with might,
China's market warriors guard it day and night.

Where sentiments may sway like the ocean's tide,
And economic storms cause lesser hearts to hide,
Here, valorous defenders wage their valiant fight,
For every point's a step towards the future bright.

Through turmoil, they remain, unshaken, undeterred,
Their resolve like the Wall, storied and assured.
A symbol of the strength that unity can wield,
Three thousand points—a shield upon the field.

It's not just a number, but a line in the sand,
A testament to will when together we stand.
As China's market thrives, let this chorus be heard,
"Three thousand points, our battle cry, onward toward victory!"


在金融领域，牛熊起舞间，
一道坚线，如同祖传之矛兵刃。
三千点，坚守力量强大无比，
中国的市场勇士昼夜守护此界线。

在情绪可能像海潮般摇摆不定，
经济风暴让弱心者寻处避难，
正是此处，勇敢的守护者进行顽强战斗，
因为每一分点都是通往灿烂未来的步伐。

纵使动荡，他们依旧坚韧不屈，
决心如同长城，传说坚固可靠。
三千点成为了团结力量的象征，
在战场上，如同一面盾牌。

这不只是一个数字，更是一道分界线，
团结一致时我们力量的见证。
随着中国市场蓬勃发展，让这节奏响彻云霄，
"三千点，我们的战斗口号，向着胜利前进！"

 *
 * TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
 * https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
 * to implement supply mechanisms].
 *
 * We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
 * instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
 * conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
 *
 * Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
 * functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
 * allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
