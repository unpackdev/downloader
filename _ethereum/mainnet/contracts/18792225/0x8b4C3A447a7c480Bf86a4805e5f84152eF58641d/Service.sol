    10^4 corresponds to one percent, and 100 * 10^4 corresponds to one hundred percent.
    The value of 12.3456% will be written as 123,456, and 78.9% as 789,000.
    This notation allows specifying ratios with an accuracy of up to four decimal places in percentage notation (six decimal places in decimal notation).
