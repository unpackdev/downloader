    /**
     * @notice This structure defines comprehensive TGE settings, including Vesting, Lockup, and distribution rules for these tokens.
     * @dev Initially, such a structure appears as a parameter when creating a proposal in CustomProposal, after which the data from the structure is placed in the storage of the deployed TGE contract.
     * @dev In addition, these data are used as an argument in its original form in the TGEFactory contract, including when creating the initial TGE by the pool owner without a proposal.
     * @param price The price of one token in the smallest unitOfAccount (1 wei when defining the price in ETH, 0.000001 USDT when defining the price in USDT, etc.)
     * @param hardcap The maximum number of tokens that can be sold (note the ProtocolTokenFee for Governance Tokens)
     * @param softcap The minimum number of tokens that buyers must acquire for the TGE to be considered successful
     * @param minPurchase The minimum number of tokens that can be purchased by a single account (minimum one-time purchase)
     * @param maxPurchase The maximum number of tokens that can be purchased by a single account in total during the launched TGE
     * @param duration The duration of the event in blocks, after which the TGE status will be forcibly changed from Active to another
     * @param vestingParams Vesting settings for tokens acquired during this TGE
     * @param userWhiteList A list of addresses allowed to participate in this TGE. Leave the list empty to make the TGE public.
     * @param unitOfAccount The address of the ERC20 or compatible token contract, in the smallest units of which the price of one token is determined
     * @param lockupDuration The duration of token lockup (in blocks), one of two independent lockup conditions.
     * @param lockupTVL The minimum total pool balance in USD, one of two independent lockup conditions.
