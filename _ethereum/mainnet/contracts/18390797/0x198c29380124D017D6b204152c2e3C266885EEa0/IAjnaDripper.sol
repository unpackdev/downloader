 * @title AjnaDripper
 * @notice A contract that drips a fixed amount of Ajna tokens to a designated AjnaRedeemer contract every week.
 * @dev Contract drips a specified amount of Ajna tokens defined by an offchain distribition schedule ( and it's limited by +-10% changes)
 * AjnaDripper is designed to be the only instance that will hold bulk of Ajna tokens. In case of emergency, the AjnaRedeemer contract can be
 * changed by the multisig to a new contract that will enable continuity of the rewards distribution.
 * ROLES:
 * - `DEFAULT_ADMIN_ROLE`: Can change the weekly drip amount, the designated AjnaRedeemer contract, \
 * and call the emergencyWithdraw function to transfer the Ajna tokens to the beneficiary address (trusted summer.fi address).
 * - `REDEEMER_ROLE`: Can call the drip function to transfer the weekly drip amount to the designated AjnaRedeemer contract (redeemer).
