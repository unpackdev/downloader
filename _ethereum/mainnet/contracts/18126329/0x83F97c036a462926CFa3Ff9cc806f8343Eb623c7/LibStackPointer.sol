/// @notice A `StackPointer` is just a pointer to some memory. Ostensibly it is
/// pointing at a stack item in memory used by the `RainInterpreter` so that
/// means it can move "up" and "down" (increment and decrement) by `uint256`
/// (32 bytes) increments. Structurally a stack is a `uint256[]` but we can save
/// a lot of gas vs. default Solidity handling of array indexes by using assembly
/// to bypass runtime bounds checks on every read and write. Of course, this
/// means we have to introduce some mechanism that gives us equivalent guarantees
/// and we do, in the form of the `IExpressionDeployerV1` integrity check.
///
/// The pointer to the bottom of a stack points at the 0th item, NOT the length
/// of the implied `uint256[]` and the top of a stack points AFTER the last item.
/// e.g. consider a `uint256[]` in memory with values `3 A B C` and assume this
/// starts at position `0` in memory, i.e. `0` points to value `3` for the
/// array length. In this case the stack bottom would be
/// `StackPointer.wrap(0x20)` (32 bytes above 0, past the length) and the stack
/// top would be `StackPointer.wrap(0x80)` (96 bytes above the stack bottom).
///
/// Most of the functions in this library are equivalent to each other via
/// composition, i.e. everything could be achieved with just `up`, `down`,
/// `pop`, `push`, `peek`. The reason there is so much overloaded/duplicated
/// logic is that the Solidity compiler seems to fail at inlining equivalent
/// logic quite a lot. Perhaps once the IR compilation of Solidity is better
/// supported by tooling etc. we could remove a lot of this duplication as the
/// compiler itself would handle the optimisations.
