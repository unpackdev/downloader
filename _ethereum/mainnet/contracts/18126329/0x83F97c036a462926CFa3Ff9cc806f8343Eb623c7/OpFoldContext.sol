/// @title OpFoldContext
/// Folds over columns of context from their start to end. Expressions do not
/// have a good way of handling dynamic lengths of things, and that is
/// intentional to avoid end users having to write out looping constructs of the
/// form `i = 0; i < length; i++` is is so tedious and error prone in software
/// development generally. It is very easy to implement "off by one" errors in
/// this form, and requires sourcing a length from somewhere. This opcode exposes
/// a pretty typical fold as found elsewhere in functional programming. A start
/// column and width of columns can be specified, the rows will be iterated and
/// pushed to the stack on top of any additional inputs specified by the
/// expression. The additional inputs are the accumulators and so the number of
/// outputs in the called source needs to match the number of accumulator inputs.
/// An initial row offset can be specified to allow a fixed number of additional
/// context items to be used in expressions while still allowing a dynamic
/// iterator over the tail of the column.
