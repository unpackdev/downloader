/**
    * @title Token Generation Event Contract
    * @notice The Token Generation Event (TGE) is the cornerstone of everything related to tokens issued on the CompanyDAO protocol. TGE contracts contain the rules and deadlines for token distribution events and can influence the pool's operational activities even after they have ended.
    The launch of the TGE event takes place simultaneously with the deployment of the contract, after which the option to purchase tokens becomes immediately available. Tokens purchased by a user can be partially or fully minted to the buyer's address and can also be placed in the vesting reserve either in full or for the remaining portion. Additionally, tokens acquired during the TGE and held in the buyer's balance may have their transfer functionality locked (the user owns, uses them as votes, delegates, but cannot transfer the tokens to another address).
    * @dev TGE events differ by the type of tokens being distributed:
    - Governance Token Generation Event
    - Preference Token Generation Event
    When deploying the TGE contract, among other arguments, the callData field contains the token field, which contains the address of the token contract that will interact with the TGE contract. The token type can be determined from the TokenType state variable of the token contract.
    Differences between these types:
    - Governance Token Generation Event involves charging a ProtocolTokenFee in the amount set in the Service:protocolTokenFee value (percentages in DENOM notation). This fee is collected through the transferFunds() transaction after the completion of the Governance token distribution event (the funds collected from buyers go to the pool balance, and the protocolTokenFee is minted and sent to the Service:protocolTreasury).
    - Governance Token Generation Event has a mandatory minPurchase limit equal to the Service:protocolTokenFee (in the smallest indivisible token parts, taking into account Decimals and DENOM). This is done to avoid rounding conflicts or overcharges when calculating the fee for each issued token volume.
    - In addition to being launched as a result of a proposal execution, a Governance Token Generation Event can be launched by the pool Owner as long as the pool has not acquired DAO status. Preference Token Generation Event can only be launched as a result of a proposal execution.
    - A successful Governance Token Generation Event (see TGE states later) leads to the pool becoming a DAO if it didn't previously have that status.
    @dev **TGE events differ by the number of previous launches:**
    - primary TGE
    - secondary TGE
    As long as the sum of the totalSupply and the vesting reserve of the distributed token does not equal the cap, a TGE can be launched to issue some more of these tokens.
    The first TGE for the distribution of any token is called primary, and all subsequent ones are called secondary.
    Differences between these types:
    - A transaction to launch a primary TGE involves the simultaneous deployment of the token contract, while a secondary TGE only works with an existing token contract.
    - A secondary TGE does not have a softcap parameter, meaning that after at least one minPurchase of tokens, the TGE is considered successful.
    - When validating the hardcap (i.e., the maximum possible number of tokens available for sale/distribution within the TGE) during the creation of a primary TGE, only a formal check is performed (hardcap must not be less than softcap and not greater than cap). For a secondary TGE, tokens that will be minted during vesting claims are also taken into account.
    - In case of failure of a primary TGE for any token, that token is not considered to have any application within the protocol. It is no longer possible to conduct a TGE for such a token.

    This notation allows specifying ratios with an accuracy of up to four decimal places in percentage notation (six decimal places in decimal notation).

    To create a DAO with a finite number of participants, each of whom should receive an equal share of tokens, you can set the whitelist when launching the TGE as a list of the participants' addresses, and set both minPurchase and maxPurchase equal to the expression (hardcap / number of participants). To make the pool obtain DAO status only if the distribution is successful under such conditions for all project participants, you can set the softcap value equal to the hardcap. With these settings, the company will become a DAO only if all the initial participants have an equal voting power.

    * @dev The TGE event may continue to affect other components of the protocol even after its completion and status change to "Successful" and, less frequently, "Failed". Vesting can be set up to distribute tokens over a significant period of time after the end of the TGE.
    The vesting time calculation begins with the block ending the TGE. The calculation of uniform time intervals is carried out either from the end of the cliff period block or each subsequent interval is counted from the end of the previous block.
    The Vesting.unlockedBalanceOf method shows how much of the tokens for a particular TGE may be available for a claim by an address if that address has not requested a withdrawal of any amount of tokens. The Vesting.claimableBalanceOf method shows how many tokens in total within a particular TGE an address has already requested and successfully received for withdrawal. Subtracting the second value from the first using the same arguments for method calls will give you the number of tokens currently available for withdrawal by that address.
    Additionally, one of the conditions for unlocking tokens under the vesting program can be setting a cumulative pool balance of a specified amount. The compliance with this condition starts to be tracked by the backend, and as soon as the pool balance reaches or exceeds the specified amount even for a moment, the backend, on behalf of the wallet with the SERVICE_MANAGER role, sends a transaction to the vesting contract's setClaimTVLReached(address tge) method. Executing this transaction changes the value of the flag in the mapping mapping(address => bool) with a key equal to the TGE address. Raising this flag is irreversible, meaning that a one-time occurrence of the condition guarantees that the token request now depends only on the second part of the conditions related to the passage of time. The calculation of the cliff period and additional distribution intervals is not related to raising this flag, both conditions are independent of each other, not mandatory for simultaneous use in settings, but mandatory for simultaneous compliance if they were used in one set of settings.
    The vesting of one TGE does not affect the vesting of another TGE.
