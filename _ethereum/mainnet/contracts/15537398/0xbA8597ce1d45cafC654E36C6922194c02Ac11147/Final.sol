//    Honestly guys, I've had enough of this crap. Where’s the transparency from the team I mean the floor is dropping and not a single word. Just rug me already. I can’t stand losing my money any longer. If this persists I will take legal action. Id like to inform you that my dad is a lawyer, and a good one at that. Top 10 in the country. You don’t want trouble devs. The SEC is already  taking a peek at this project. I can stop this as long as devs do something    //

//    I am not yet sure of how my account was compromised. I have two prevailing theories, both are, to my mind, highly unlikely. One is an insider at Twitter being involved; this was my immediate reaction, and while still possible, I don’t consider it an especially high likelihood. The other is a phishing attack on me where I gave access to an attacker to the extent that they could bypass my Google Authenticator 2FA. -Zeneca                                         //
