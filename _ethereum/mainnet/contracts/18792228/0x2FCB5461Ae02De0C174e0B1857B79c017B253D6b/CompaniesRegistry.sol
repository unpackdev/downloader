 *@title Companies Registry Contract
 *@notice This contract is a section of the Registry contract designed for storing and manipulating companies listed for sale.
 *@dev With the help of this contract, one can find out the number of companies available for purchase in a specific jurisdiction and their corresponding prices. Here, an isolated but still dependent role-based model based on Access Control from OZ is implemented, with the contract Service playing a crucial role.

    * @notice Hash code for the COMPANIES_MANAGER role in the OpenZeppelin (OZ) Access Control model.
    * @dev This role is intended for working with the showcase of companies available for purchase and can also add and modify the link to the organization's charter. It operates only within the Registry contract through a separate AccessControl model from OpenZeppelin with standard methods: grantRole, revokeRole, setRole.
    Methods:
    - CompaniesRegistry.sol:createCompany(CompanyInfo calldata info) - creating a company with specified immutable data and its price in ETH, deploying the contract with a temporary owner in the form of the Registry contract proxy address. After calling such a method, the company immediately becomes available for purchase.
    - CompaniesRegistry.sol:deleteCompany(uint256 jurisdiction, uint256 entityType, uint256 id) - deleting a company record (removing it from sale without the possibility of recovery).
    - Pool.sol:setOAUrl(string memory _uri) - changing the link to the pool's operating agreement.
    Storage, assignment, and revocation of the role are carried out using the standard methods of the AccessControl model from OpenZeppelin: grantRole, revokeRole, setRole. The holder of the standard ADMIN_ROLE of this contract can manage this role (by default - the address that deployed the contract).
