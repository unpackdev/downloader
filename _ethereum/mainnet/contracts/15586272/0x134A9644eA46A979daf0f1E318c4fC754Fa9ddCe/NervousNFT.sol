// # OWNERSHIP LICENSE
//
// This Ownership License sets forth the terms of the agreement between you, on
// the one hand, and Buff Monster (the "Artist") and Maraschino Distribution LLC,
// a company ("Company"), on the other hand, with respect to your ownership and
// use of the Mini Melties, a collection of 2000 digital characters by the Artist
// (the "Artwork") to which this Ownership License applies.
//
// References to "you" herein mean the legal owner of the digital non-fungible
// token ("NFT") minted as the Artwork, as recorded on the applicable blockchain.
// References to "us" herein means the Company and the Artist, jointly and
// severally. References to the "Artwork" herein means the NFT, the creative and
// audiovisual design implemented, secured, and authenticated by the NFT, and the
// associated code and data that collectively constitute the above-referenced
// digital work of art.
//
// Your acquisition of the Artwork constitutes your acceptance of, and agreement
// to, the terms of this Ownership License.
//
// ## Ownership of the Artwork.
//
// References herein to your ownership of the Artwork mean your exclusive
// ownership of the authenticated NFT that constitutes the digital original of the
// Artwork, as such ownership is recorded on the applicable blockchain. Only a
// person or entity with the legal right to access and control the cryptocurrency
// address or account to which the Artwork is assigned on the blockchain will
// qualify as an owner of the Artwork hereunder.
//
// ## Your Ownership Rights.
//
// For so long as you remain the owner of the Artwork you will be entitled to
// exercise the following rights with respect to the Artwork (the "Ownership
// Rights"):
//
// - To store the Artwork in any account (i.e., cryptocurrency address) and
// to freely transfer the Artwork between accounts.
//
// - To privately view and display the Artwork for your personal purposes on
// any device.
//
// - To sell the Artwork to any third party, to exchange it in a swap with
// any third party, to list and offer it for sale or swap on any marketplace
// and/or through any platform or outlet that supports such sale or swap, to
// donate or gift the Artwork to any third party, and to transfer ownership of the
// Artwork to the applicable purchaser or other intended recipient.
//
// - To reproduce the visual imagery (and any audio, if applicable) produced
// by the Artwork (the "Imagery") in both digital media (e.g., online) and
// physical media (e.g., print) for your reasonable, private, noncommercial
// purposes, such as displaying the Imagery on your personal website and/or in
// your personal social media, or including the Imagery as an informational
// illustration in a book, magazine article or other publication dealing with your
// personal art collection.
//
// - To use the Imagery as your personal profile image or avatar, or as a
// similar personal graphic that serves to personally identify you in your
// personal social media and in comparable personal noncommercial contexts.
//
// - To include and exhibit theArtwork, as a digital work of fine art by the
// Artist, in any public or private art exhibition (or any comparable context),
// whether organized by you or by any third party such as a museum or gallery, by
// means of a Qualifying Display Device installed on site if the exhibition is
// presented in a physical space, or, if the exhibition is presented solely online
// or by other purely digital means, display and exhibition in a reasonably
// comparable manner. As used herein, a "Qualifying Display Device" means a video
// monitor, projector, or other physical display device sufficient to display the
// Artwork in a resolution and manner that does not distort, degrade, or otherwise
// materially alter the original Artwork.
//
// The foregoing rights are exclusive to you, subject to the rights retained by
// the Artist below.
//
// The Ownership Rights also include the limited, nonexclusive right to make use
// of the Artist's name and the Artist's IP Rights (as defined below) to the
// extent required to enable you to exercise the aforementioned usage rights.
//
// ## Faithful Display & Reproduction.
//
// The Artwork may not be materially altered or changed, and must be faithfully
// displayed and reproduced in the form originally minted. The Ownership Rights
// only apply to the Artwork in this original form, and do not apply to, and may
// not be exercised in connection with, any version of the Artwork that has been
// materially altered or changed.
//
// ## Excluded Uses.
//
// You may not reproduce, display, use, or exploit the Artwork in any manner other
// than as expressly permitted by the Ownership Rights, as set forth above. In
// particular, without limitation, the Ownership Rights do not include any right
// to reproduce, display, use, or exploit the Artwork for any of the following
// purposes or usages:
//
// - To create any derivative work based on the Artwork.
//
// - To reproduce the Artwork for merchandising purposes (e.g., to produce
// goods offered for sale or given away as premiums or for promotional purposes).
//
// - To make use of the Artwork as a logo, trademark, service mark, or in any
// similar manner (other than personal use as your personally identifying profile
// image, avatar, or graphic, as expressly permitted above).
//
// - Use of the Artwork to promote or advertise any brand, product, product
// line, or service.
//
// - Use for any political purpose or to promote any political or other cause.
//
// - Any other use of the Artwork for your commercial benefit or the
// commercial benefit of any third party (other than resale of the Artwork, as
// expressly permitted above).
//
// - Use of the Artist's IP Rights for any purpose other than as reasonably
// required for exercise of the Ownership Rights, such as, without limitation, use
// of the Artist's name for endorsement, advertising, trademark, or other
// commercial purposes.
//
// ## Artist's Intellectual Property Rights.
//
// Subject to your Ownership Rights (and excluding any intellectual property owned
// by Company), the Artist is and will at all times be and remain the sole owner
// of the copyrights, patent rights, trademark rights, and all other
// intellectual-property rights in and relating to the Artwork (collectively, the
// "Artist's IP Rights"), including, without limitation: (i) the Imagery; (ii) the
// programming, algorithms, and code used to generate the Imagery, and the
// on-chain software code, script, and data constituting the applicable NFT (but
// excluding, for the avoidance of doubt, programming, script, algorithms, data,
// and/or code provided by Company and/or used in connection with the operation of
// the Company platform and marketplace) (collectively, the "Code"); (iii) any
// data incorporated in and/or used by the Artwork, whether stored on or off the
// blockchain; (iv) the title of the Artwork; and (v) the Artist's name,
// signature, likeness, and other personally identifying indicia. The Artist's IP
// Rights are, and at all times will remain, the sole property of the Artist, and
// all rights therein not expressly granted herein are reserved to the Artist. The
// Artist also retains all moral rights afforded in each applicable jurisdiction
// with respect to the Artwork. You hereby irrevocably assign to the Artist any
// and all rights or ownership you may have, or claim to have, in any item falling
// within the definition of the Artist's IP Rights, including, without limitation,
// the copyrights in the Imagery and in the Code. We, the Artist and Company, will
// be free to reproduce the Imagery and the Artwork for the Artist's and Company's
// customary artistic and professional purposes (including, without limitation,
// use in books, publications, materials, websites, social media, and exhibitions
// dealing with the Artist's creative work, and licensing for merchandising,
// advertising, endorsement, and/or other commercial purposes), and to re-use
// and/or adapt the Code for any other purpose or project (including, without
// limitation, the creation and sale of other NFTs), and to register any or all of
// the Artist's IP Rights (including, without limitation, the copyrights in
// theImagery and the Code) solely in the name of the Artist or his designee.
//
// ## Transfer of Artwork.
//
// The Ownership Rights are granted to you only for so long as you remain the
// legal owner of the Artwork. If and when you sell, swap, donate, gift, give
// away, "burn," or otherwise cease to own the Artwork for any reason, your rights
// to exercise any of the Ownership Rights will immediately and automatically
// terminate. When the Artwork is legally transferred to a new owner, as recorded
// on the applicable blockchain, the new owner will thereafter be entitled to
// exercise the Ownership Rights, and references to "you" herein will thereafter
// be deemed to refer to the new owner.
//
// ## Resale Royalty.
//
// With respect to any resale of the Artwork, the Artist will be entitled to
// receive an amount equal to 7.5% of the amount paid by such purchaser (the
// "Resale Royalty"). For example, for any sale of the Artwork, following the
// original sale, to a subsequent purchaser for 1.0 ETH, the Resale Royalty due
// will be 0.075 ETH to the Artist. The Resale Royalty is intended to be deducted
// and paid pursuant to the smart contract implemented in the Code whenever the
// Artwork is resold after the initial sale. However, if for any reason the full
// amount due as the Resale Royalty is not deducted and paid (for example, if some
// or all of the applicable purchase price is paid outside the blockchain), in
// addition to any other available remedies the Artist and Company will be
// entitled (i) to recover the full unpaid amount of the Resale Royalty along with
// any attorneys' fees and other costs reasonably incurred to enable such
// recovery; (ii) to terminate and suspend the Ownership Rights until full payment
// is received; and (iii) to obtain injunctive or other equitable relief in any
// applicable jurisdiction.
//
// ## Illegal Acquisition.
//
// If the Artwork is acquired by unauthorized means, such as an unauthorized or
// unintended transfer to a new cryptocurrency address as the result of hacking,
// fraud, phishing, conversion, or other unauthorized action, the following terms
// will apply until such time as the Artwork is returned to its rightful owner:
// (i) the Ownership Rights will immediately terminate and be deemed suspended;
// (ii) the Artist will be entitled to withhold recognition of the Artwork as
// constituting an authentic work of fine art by him; and (iii) the Artist and/or
// Company will be entitled to take any and all steps necessary to prevent the
// Artwork from being sold or traded, including, without limitation, causing the
// Artwork to be removed from the Company platform and/or any marketplace or
// platform where it is listed for sale. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
// herein will obligate the Artist or Company to take any action with respect to
// any unauthorized acquisition or disposition of the Artwork, and neither we nor
// they will have any liability in this regard.
//
// ## Limited Guarantee.
//
// We guarantee that the Artwork will constitute an authentic original digital
// work of fine art by the Artist. In all other respects, the Artwork and the NFT
// are provided strictly "as is." Neither the Artist nor Company makes any other
// representation, provides any other warranty, or assumes any liability of any
// kind whatsoever in connection with the Artwork, including, without limitation,
// any representations, warranties, or conditions, express or implied, as to
// merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, functionality, technical
// quality or performance, freedom from malware or errors, or value, each of which
// representations, warranties, and conditions is expressly disclaimed. No
// statement made by the Artist or Company (or by any listing platform or
// marketplace), whether oral or in writing, will be deemed to constitute any such
// representation, warranty, or condition. EXCEPT AS EXPRESSLY PROVIDED ABOVE, THE
// ARTWORK AND THE NFT ARE PROVIDED ENTIRELY ON AN "AS IS" AND "AS AVAILABLE"
// BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
//
// ## Your Knowledge & Experience.
//
// You represent and warrant that you are knowledgeable, experienced, and
// sophisticated in using blockchain and cryptocurrency technology and that you
// understand and accept the risks associated with technological and cryptographic
// systems such as blockchains, NFTs, cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, consensus
// algorithms, decentralized or peer-to-peer networks and systems, and similar
// systems and technologies, which risks may include malfunctions, bugs, timing
// errors, transfer errors, hacking and theft, changes to the protocol rules of
// the blockchain (e.g., forks), hardware, software and/or Internet connectivity
// failures, unauthorized third-party data access, and other technological risks,
// any of which can adversely affect the Artwork and expose you to a risk of loss,
// forfeiture of your digital currency or NFTs, or lost opportunities to buy or
// sell digital assets.
//
// ## Acknowledgement of Inherent Risks. You acknowledge and accept that:
//
// - The prices of blockchain assets, including NFTs, are extremely volatile
// and unpredictable as the result of technological, social, market, subjective,
// and other factors and forces that are not within our, the Artist's, or
// Company's control.
//
// - Digital assets such as the Artwork may have little or no inherent or
// intrinsic value.
//
// - Fluctuations in the pricing or markets of digital assets such as the
// Artwork could materially and adversely affect the value of the Artwork, which
// may be subject to significant price volatility.
//
// - Providing information and conducting business over the Internet and via
// related technological means with respect to cryptocurrencies and digital assets
// such as the NFT entails substantial inherent security risks that are or may be
// unavoidable.
//
// - Due to the aforementioned risk factors and other factors that cannot be
// predicted or controlled, there is no assurance whatsoever that the Artwork will
// retain its value at the original purchase price or that it will attain any
// future value thereafter.
//
// ## Limitation of Liability.
//
// Our and Company's maximum total liability to you for any claim arising or
// asserted hereunder or otherwise in connection with the Artwork will be limited
// to the amount paid by the original purchaser for the original primary-market
// purchase of the Artwork. Under no circumstances will the Artist or Company be
// liable for any other loss or damage arising in connection with the Artwork,
// including, without limitation, loss or damage resulting from or arising in
// connection with:
//
// - Unauthorized third-party activities and actions, such as hacking,
// exploits, introduction of viruses or other malicious code, phishing, Sybil
// attacks, 51% attacks, brute forcing, mining attacks, cybersecurity attacks, or
// other means of attack that affect the Artwork in any way.
//
// - Weaknesses in security, blockchain malfunctions, or other technical
// errors.
//
// - Telecommunications or Internet failures.
//
// - Any protocol change or hard fork in the blockchain on which the Artwork
// is recorded.
//
// - Errors by you (such as forgotten passwords, lost private keys, or
// mistyped addresses).
//
// - Errors by us (such as incorrectly constructed transactions or
// incorrectly programmed NFTs).
//
// - Unfavorable regulatory determinations or actions, or newly implemented
// laws or regulations, in any jurisdiction.
//
// - Taxation of NFTs or cryptocurrencies, the uncertainty of the tax
// treatment of NFT or cryptocurrency transactions, and any changes in applicable
// tax laws, in any jurisdiction.
//
// - Your inability to access, transfer, sell, or use the Artwork for any
// reason.
//
// - Personal information disclosures or breaches.
//
// - Total or partial loss of value of the Artwork due to the inherent price
// volatility of digital blockchain-based and cryptocurrency assets and markets.
//
// **UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL WE BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL,
// INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES OF ANY KIND, EVEN IF WE HAVE
// BEEN ADVISED OR OTHERWISE WERE AWARE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.**
//
// The foregoing limitations on our liability apply to all claims, whether based
// in contract, tort, or any other legal or equitable theory.
//
// Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein will be deemed to exclude or
// limit in any way the Artist's or Company's liability if it would be unlawful to
// do so, such as any liability that cannot legally be excluded or limited under
// applicable law. It is acknowledged that the laws of some jurisdictions do not
// allow some or all of the disclaimers, limitations or exclusions set forth
// herein. If these laws apply in your case, some or all of the foregoing
// disclaimers, limitations or exclusions may not apply to you, and you may have
// additional rights.
//
// ## Indemnification & Release.
//
// To the fullest extent permitted under applicable law, you agree to indemnify,
// defend and hold harmless the Artist and Company and their respective
// affiliates, and, as applicable, their respective officers, employees, agents,
// affiliates, legal representatives, heirs, successors, licensees, and assigns
// (jointly and severally, the "Indemnified Parties") from and against any and all
// claims, causes of action, costs, proceedings, demands, obligations, losses,
// liabilities, penalties, damages, awards, judgments, interest, fees, and
// expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and legal, court, settlement,
// and other related costs) of any kind or nature, in law or equity, whether in
// tort, contract or otherwise, arising out of or relating to, any actual or
// alleged breach by you of the terms of this Ownership License or your use or
// misuse of the NFT or Artwork.
//
// You hereby release, acquit, and forever discharge each of the Indemnified
// Parties from any damages, suits, or controversies or causes of action resulting
// from your acquisition, transfer, sale, disposition, or use of the NFT or
// Artwork in violation of the terms of this Ownership License, and you hereby
// waive the provision of California Civil Code Section 1542 (if and as
// applicable), which says: "A general release does not extend to claims that the
// creditor or releasing party does not know or suspect to exist in his or her
// favor at the time of executing the release and that, if known by him or her,
// would have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor or
// released party." If any comparable legal provision applies in any other
// jurisdiction, you hereby also waive such provision to the maximum extent
// permitted by law.
//
// ## Applicable Law.
//
// This Ownership License is governed by the laws of New York State applicable to
// contracts to be wholly performed therein, without reference to
// conflicts-of-laws provisions.
//
// ## Arbitration.
//
// Any and all disputes or claims arising out of or relating to this Ownership
// License will be resolved by binding arbitration in New York State, and not by
// court action except with respect to prejudgment remedies such as injunctive
// relief. Each party will bear such party's own costs in connection with the
// arbitration. Judgment upon any arbitral award may be entered and enforced in
// any court of competent jurisdiction.
//
// ## Waiver of Jury Trial.
//
// YOU AND WE WAIVE ANY AND ALL CONSTITUTIONAL AND STATUTORY RIGHTS TO SUE IN
// COURT AND TO HAVE A TRIAL IN FRONT OF A JUDGE OR A JURY. You and we have
// instead agreed that all claims and disputes arising hereunder will be resolved
// by arbitration, as provided above.
//
// ## Waiver of Class Action.
//
// ALL CLAIMS AND DISPUTES FALLING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ARBITRATION HEREUNDER MUST
// BE ARBITRATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS, AND NOT ON A CLASS-ACTION,
// COLLECTIVE-CLASS, OR NON-INDIVIDUALIZED BASIS. YOUR CLAIMS CANNOT BE ARBITRATED
// OR CONSOLIDATED WITH THOSE OF ANY OTHER OWNER OF AN NFT OR OTHER WORK BY THE
// ARTIST. If applicable law precludes enforcement of this limitation as to a
// given claim for relief, the claim must be severed from the arbitration and
// brought in the applicable court located in New York State. All other claims
// must be arbitrated, as provided above.
//
// ## Artist's Successor.
//
// After the Artist's lifetime, the rights granted to the Artist herein will be
// exercised by the successor owner of the Artist's IP Rights, which owner will be
// deemed the Artist's successor for all purposes hereunder.
//
// ## Modifications & Waivers.
//
// The terms of this Ownership License cannot be amended or waived except in a
// written document signed by an authorized person on behalf of the Artist and
// Company. Our failure in any instance to exercise or enforce any right or
// provision of this Ownership License will not constitute a waiver of such right
// or provision.
//
// ## Severability.
//
// If any term, clause, or provision of this Ownership License is held to be
// invalid or unenforceable, it will be deemed severed from the remaining terms
// hereof and will not be deemed to affect the validity or enforceability of such
// terms.
//
// ## Conflicting Terms.
//
// In the event of any conflict between the terms of this Ownership License and
// any terms imposed by or in connection with any platform, marketplace, or
// similar service or application on which the Artwork is offered, listed, sold,
// traded, swapped, gifted, transferred, or included the terms of this Ownership
// License will control.
//
// ## Entire Agreement.
//
// This Ownership License sets forth the entire agreement between the parties with
// respect to the Artwork, superseding all previous agreements, understandings,
// statements, discussions, and arrangements in this regard.
//
// ## Contact.
