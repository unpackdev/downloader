When you think you've seen it all, the shadows dance with another tale. Shadecreeper wasn't just any regular at The Lonely Serpent; 
he was its legend, its myth, its meme. Every evening, as the moon took its throne, he swaggered in, promising tales of mystery and adventure. But one fateful night, when the innkeeper dared to ask for gold, our hero chose a different currency.

Cursed blobs of slime oozed into every corner, every goblet, every unsuspecting patron's shoe. Was it revenge? Or a master plan? As the blobs multiplied and the tavern turned into a glistening fortress of jelly, the digital realm trembled. The cursed slime? It wasn't just any mess; it was the genesis of the $SCP token.

Tax: A Whopping None! Zero detours on your slime journey!
TOTAL SUPPLY: 1 Billion - A legendary stash!
