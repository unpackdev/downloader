 *         contract. If the ERC20 token is native to L2, it will be burnt. ETH is instead stored
 *         inside the KromaPortal contract.
 *         NOTE: this contract is not intended to support all variations of ERC20 tokens. Examples
 *         of some token types that may not be properly supported by this contract include, but are
 *         not limited to: tokens with transfer fees, rebasing tokens, and tokens with blocklists.
