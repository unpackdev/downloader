/**
 * @title SplitAtomicV0
 * @author Art Blocks Inc.
 * @notice This contract splits received funds according to the configured
 * `splits`, which are immutably configured at initialization time.
 * Each split is defined as a `recipient` address and a `basisPoints` value.
 * The total of all `basisPoints` values must add up to 10_000 (100%), which
 * is verified at initialization time. All splits must be non-zero.
 *
 * When the contract receives funds, it splits the funds according to the
 * configured `splits`. The contract can also manually split any funds that
 * were sent outside of the `receive` function via the `drainETH` function.
 * Additionally, a `drainERC20` function is provided to split any ERC20 tokens
 * that were sent to the contract.
 *
 * There may be a small amount of funds left behind when splitting funds, due
 * to integer division rounding down. This is conservatively safe (will always
 * run a split), but may leave a small amount of funds behind (e.g. a few wei).
 * The small amount of funds left behind can always be drained later, but
 * likely never worth the gas.
