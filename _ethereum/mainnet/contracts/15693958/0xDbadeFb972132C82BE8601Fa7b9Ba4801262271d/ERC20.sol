/**
* @notice Implementation of the {IERC20Metadata} interface.
* The IERC20Metadata interface extends the IERC20 interface.
*
* This implementation is agnostic to the way tokens are created. This means
* that a supply mechanism has to be added in a derived contract using {_mint}.
* For a generic mechanism see Open Zeppelins {ERC20PresetMinterPauser}.
*
* TIP: For a detailed writeup see our guide
* https://forum.zeppelin.solutions/t/how-to-implement-erc20-supply-mechanisms/226[How
* to implement supply mechanisms].
*
* We have followed general OpenZeppelin Contracts guidelines: functions revert
* instead returning `false` on failure. This behavior is nonetheless
* conventional and does not conflict with the expectations of ERC20
* applications.
*
* Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
* This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
* by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
* these events, as it isn't required by the specification.
*
* Finally, the non-standard {decreaseAllowance} and {increaseAllowance}
* functions have been added to mitigate the well-known issues around setting
* allowances. See {IERC20-approve}.
