ZipClash Game
Nobody in the latter part of the 20th century would have imagined that one could earn real 
money just by playing games. Nonetheless, we are steadily progressing toward that world. 
By and large, a shift is occurring in the gaming industry, with games being published on 
blockchains and utilizing digital currencies (cryptocurrencies), decentralized exchanges/trading, 
and economies based on digital assets. These assets are frequently Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) 
to ensure their authenticity and uniqueness. As a result, the degree to which in-game graphics 
and objects may be monetized has expanded significantly during the last decade. Regardless, 
advancements in blockchain innovation are elevating Play-to-Earn (P2E) gaming to new heights. 
Anyone may earn money from the gaming space thanks to P2E games. As awareness of Play-to-Earn 
games grows, P2E games are virtually capturing market share in every contemporary form of gaming. 
Compared to traditional Pay-to-Win games, blockchain and NFT-based games establish a balance 
between Pay-to-Win and Play-to-Earn, Knight War-The Holy Trio is a blockchain game of this type.
Our Vision
We believe in a future in which work and play become one.
We believe in empowering players and providing them with economic opportunities.
Most of all, we believe in the dream of an intergalactic restaurant.
Ecosystem
The main difference between ZipClash and other Idle/Clicker games is its Play-to-Earn income model 
and economic structure that empowers players to keep playing the game for the foreseeable future. 
In other famous games like Axie Infinity, the bull run of the game started facing a downfall after years 
of its creation, leaving many playersâ€™ expectations and investment goals unfulfilled. In this game, 
every player could create a lot of daily SLP, but there were few ways to use the currency. In other words, 
the supply surpassed the demand, which doomed the game to crash sooner or later. In ZipClash, 
however, the leaderboard clusters and C/S model will make it impossible to generate a higher supply 
than demand because the income graph of the players does not increase exponentially.
