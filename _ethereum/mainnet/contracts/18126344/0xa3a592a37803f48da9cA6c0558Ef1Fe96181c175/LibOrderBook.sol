/// All information resulting from an order calculation that allows for vault IO
/// to be calculated and applied, then the handle IO entrypoint to be dispatched.
/// @param outputMax The UNSCALED maximum output calculated by the order
/// expression. WILL BE RESCALED ACCORDING TO TOKEN DECIMALS to an 18 fixed
/// point decimal number for the purpose of calculating actual vault movements.
/// The output max is CAPPED AT THE OUTPUT VAULT BALANCE OF THE ORDER OWNER.
/// The order is guaranteed that the total output of this single clearance cannot
/// exceed this (subject to rescaling). It is up to the order expression to track
/// values over time if the output max is to impose a global limit across many
/// transactions and counterparties.
/// @param IORatio The UNSCALED order ratio as input/output from the perspective
/// of the order. As each counterparty's input is the other's output, the IORatio
/// calculated by each order is inverse of its counterparty. IORatio is SCALED
/// ACCORDING TO TOKEN DECIMALS to allow 18 decimal fixed point math over the
/// vault balances. I.e. `1e18` returned from the expression is ALWAYS "one" as
/// ECONOMIC EQUIVALENCE between two tokens, but this will be rescaled according
/// to the decimals of the token. For example, if DAI and USDT have a ratio of
/// `1e18` then in reality `1e12` DAI will move in the vault for every `1` USDT
/// that moves, because DAI has `1e18` decimals per $1 peg and USDT has `1e6`
/// decimals per $1 peg. THE ORDER DEFINES THE DECIMALS for each token, NOT the
/// token itself, because the token MAY NOT report its decimals as per it being
/// optional in the ERC20 specification.
/// @param context The entire 2D context array, initialized from the context
/// passed into the order calculations and then populated with the order
/// calculations and vault IO before being passed back to handle IO entrypoint.
/// @param namespace The `StateNamespace` to be passed to the store for calculate
/// IO state changes.
/// @param kvs KVs returned from calculate order entrypoint to pass to the store
/// before calling handle IO entrypoint.
