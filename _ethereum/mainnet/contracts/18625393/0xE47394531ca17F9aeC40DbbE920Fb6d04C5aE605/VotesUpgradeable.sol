/**
 * @dev This is a base abstract contract that tracks voting units, which are a measure of voting power that can be
 * transferred, and provides a system of vote delegation, where an account can delegate its voting units to a sort of
 * "representative" that will pool delegated voting units from different accounts and can then use it to vote in
 * decisions. In fact, voting units _must_ be delegated in order to count as actual votes, and an account has to
 * delegate those votes to itself if it wishes to participate in decisions and does not have a trusted representative.
 *
 * This contract is often combined with a token contract such that voting units correspond to token units. For an
 * example, see {ERC721Votes}.
 *
 * The full history of delegate votes is tracked on-chain so that governance protocols can consider votes as distributed
 * at a particular block number to protect against flash loans and double voting. The opt-in delegate system makes the
 * cost of this history tracking optional.
 *
 * When using this module the derived contract must implement {_getVotingUnits} (for example, make it return
 * {ERC721-balanceOf}), and can use {_transferVotingUnits} to track a change in the distribution of those units (in the
 * previous example, it would be included in {ERC721-_beforeTokenTransfer}).

 *  
 * FORK INFORMATION
 * This contract has been modified for use in thunderhead-labs/stflip-contracts. stFLIP is an LST that also serves as a voting
 * token in governance to ensure it remains non-custodial. Voting should not be opt-in to ensure users keep control.
 * 
 * Modifications made in order of appearance:
 * 1. No longer inherits `ContextUpgradeable, EIP712Upgradeable, IERC5805Upgradeable` since it does not fit those interfaces
 * anymore
 * 2. Removed `_DELEGATION_TYPEHASH, _delegation, _nonces` since delegation is disabled. The "delegate" for an address is itself
 * 3. Removed functions `_delegate, delegateBySig, delegate` since delegation is disabled
 * 4. Modified `delegates(address who)` to always return `who`
 * 5. Changed `_moveDelegateVotes(delegates(from), delegates(to), amount)` to `_moveDelegateVotes(from, to, amount)` since an address delegates to itself
 * 6. Removed `DelegateVotesChanged` emission in `_moveDelegateVotes` since `Transfer` makes it redundant
 * 7. Removed functions `_useNonce, nonces, DOMAIN_SEPARATOR, _getVotingUnits` since delegation is disabled
 * 8. Increased __gap length by 2 to account for previously removed variables
 * 
 * This change is 4/45 source insertions and deletions respectively
