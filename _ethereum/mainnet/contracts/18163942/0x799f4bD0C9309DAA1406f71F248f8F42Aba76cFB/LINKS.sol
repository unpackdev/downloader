//    I graduated college the previous year and was trying to find myself.                                                                                                                                                                //

//    Although I had been writing rhymes since age 12 and had done a few shows with a group of former friends (Da Hillz Productions), I was following more than leading.                                                                  //

//    The group wasn't serious enough for me and I had conflicts with one of the other members which ended our friendship.                                                                                                                //

//    This was a monumental move for me and proceeded to open up all kinds of doors.                                                                                                                                                      //

//    In 2009, I met Warren Britt at the Nuyorican Cafe in the Lower East Side.                                                                                                                                                           //

//    I had never really invested in myself much until this point so I decided if I was going to get serious that I would need to get some professional photos done.                                                                      //

//    I met Elena, an attractive Eastern European woman who would frequent Crash Mansion, a venue I was also a regular at and where I got some of my early performance experience.                                                        //

//    I've always put my heart & soul into my music, and for a time that is all I wanted to do.                                                                                                                                           //
//                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        //
//    My return to music has always been a deep desire of mine, and while I don't have the free time I had living in my mother's basement in Brooklyn throughout my 20s, I still feel I have a story to tell and a message to deliver.    //
