/// @notice Abstract contract that liq-source specifialized contracts can inherit
/// to provide flash loan based arbitrage against external liquidity sources to
/// fill orderbook orders.
///
/// For example consider a simple order:
///
/// input = DAI
/// output = USDT
/// IORatio = 1.01e18
/// Order amount = 100e18
///
/// Assume external liq is offering 102 DAI per USDT so it exceeds the IO ratio
/// but the order itself has no way to interact with the external contract.
/// The `OrderBookFlashBorrower` can:
///
/// - Flash loan 100 USDT from `Orderbook`
/// - Sell the 100 USDT for 102 DAI on external liq
/// - Take the order, giving 101 DAI and paying down 100 USDT loan
/// - Keep 1 DAI profit
///
/// As this contract is expected to be cloned using a minimal proxy there will
/// be many copies of it in the wild. Each copy can be access gated by a Rain
/// expression that is evaluated before anything else happens in `arb`. There
/// are many reasons why this might be desirable:
/// - Regulatory reasons that restrict how an arb bot operator can interact with
///   orders and/or external liq.
/// - The arb operator wants to attempt to prevent front running by other bots.
/// - The arb operator may prefer a dedicated instance of the contract to make
///   it easier to track profits, etc.
