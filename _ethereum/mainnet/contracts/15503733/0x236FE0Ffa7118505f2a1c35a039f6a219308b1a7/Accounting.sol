/**
 * @dev Accounting is an abstract contract that encapsulates the most critical logic in the HyperLoop contracts.
 * The accounting system works by using two balances that can only increase `_credit` and `_debit`.
 * A executor's available balance is the total credit minus the total debit. The contract exposes
 * two external functions that allows a executor to stake and unstake and exposes two internal
 * functions to its child contracts that allow the child contract to add to the credit 
 * and debit balance. In addition, child contracts can override `_additionalDebit` to account
 * for any additional debit balance in an alternative way. Lastly, it exposes a modifier,
 * `requirePositiveBalance`, that can be used by child contracts to ensure the executor does not
 * use more than its available stake.
