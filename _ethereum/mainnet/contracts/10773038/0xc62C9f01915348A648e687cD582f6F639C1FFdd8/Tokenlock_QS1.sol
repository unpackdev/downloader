* QUANT_SOLDIER TOKEN LOCK-UP #1 (3,000 tokens, 4 months = 120 days)
*
* This is the contract locking the team's tokens (5% of total supply)
* Each team member (4) has 1.4% of the supply. 
* Allocation is Locked in 2 contracts (50% 4 months and 50% 10 months)
*
* Constructor has been initialized with days of locking (see: timeLockDays in the code below)
* You can interact with the contract on Etherscan to check the _release time (linux timestamp)
* 
* How does this contract work?
* look at  the function release():
* it's the only function that has the _token.transfer method, thus that can send tokens.
* it requires the condiction require(block.timestamp >= _releaseTime)
* this ensures that this function, hence the token transfer can only be activated 
* after the _releaseTime.
*
* DFT Token Address: 0xB6eE603933E024d8d53dDE3faa0bf98fE2a3d6f1
* 
* As usual, any question feel free to reach out to us.
