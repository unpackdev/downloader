  * @title Liquid staking pool
  *
  * For the high-level description of the pool operation please refer to the paper.
  * Pool manages withdrawal keys and fees. It receives ether submitted by users on the ETH 1 side
  * and stakes it via the deposit_contract.sol contract. It doesn't hold ether on it's balance,
  * only a small portion (buffer) of it.
  * It also mints new tokens for rewards generated at the ETH 2.0 side.
