// JSON-PRC invocation.  `isLiquidatable_exchange` protects `receive()` to be only invokable from
// inside of an exchange, effectively blocking ETH transfers.  Invocation from `isLiquidatable` is,
// unfortunately, still possible at the moment.  But as `isLiquidatable` should not be called
// outside of the `callStatic` by the convention of our API, it is not a high priority issue.
