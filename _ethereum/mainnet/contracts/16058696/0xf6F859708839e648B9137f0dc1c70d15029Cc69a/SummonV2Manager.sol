// previously the summon contract itself managed everything, but howwould things changed if the summon factory manged everything?
// the summon factory itself would have to have transfer power. ok thats fine. 
// the summon factory would have to deposit every token to the specific summon address, and store state about where every token is stored.
// on withdraw, the summon factory would have permissions to call a new function: safeWithdraw on the summon in question. safeWithdraw could ONLY be called by the Summon
// Factory, and would transfer the token from the summon address to the lender address


// oooh this would also allow lending tokens to a
