/// @title Split
///
/// @dev This contract allows to split Ether payments among a group of accounts. The sender does not need
/// to be aware that the Ether will be split in this way, since it is handled transparently by the contract.
///
/// The split can be in equal parts or in any other arbitrary proportion. The way this is specified is by
/// assigning each account to a number of shares. Of all the Ether that this contract receives, each account
/// will then be able to claim an amount proportional to the percentage of total shares they were assigned.
///
/// `Split` follows a _pull payment_ model. This means that payments are not automatically forwarded to the
/// accounts but kept in this contract, and the actual transfer is triggered as a separate step by calling
/// the {release} function.
