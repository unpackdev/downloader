 * @title ERC-7492 IERC20Spendable.sol
 *
 * @author omnus
 * https://omn.us
 *
 * @dev Implementation of {IERC20Spendable} interface.
 *
 * {ERC-7492 ERC20Spendable} allows ERC20s to operate as 'spendable' items, i.e. an ERC20 token that
 * can trigger an action on another contract at the same time as being transfered. Similar to ERC677
 * and the hooks in ERC777, but with more of an empasis on interoperability (returned values) than
 * ERC677 and specifically scoped interaction rather than the general hooks of ERC777.
 *
 * For more detailed notes please see our guide https://omn.us/how-to-implement-erc20-spendable
